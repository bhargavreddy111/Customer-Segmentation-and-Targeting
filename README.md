# Customer-Segmentation-and-Targeting
As a service industry, banking sector has seen success in using machine learning to target their customers with appropriate marketing strategies. By analyzing customersâ€™ transactional data and needs, banks can understand their current customers better and also expect their future ones. In detail, machine learning techniques help banks to improve their business by reaching out to different customer segments with customized loan scheme offerings. In this project, I have initially done exploratory data analysis to understand what factors could possibly influence a potential customer and then moved to use clustering techniques to split the customer data into 3 segments. Finally, I tried to predict whether an existing customer will be accepting personal loan offer using Decision Tree and Random forest models. I have managed to achieve an accuracy of 98.4% with the best performing model.
